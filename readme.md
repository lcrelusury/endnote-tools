## üß© How it works

EndNote Tools acts as a bridge among reference data, PDFs, and writing workflows. At its core, it handles three things:

1) Data import and normalization
- You bring in references from your existing libraries.
- The tool normalizes data so that metadata fields align across sources.
- It supports batch processing to scale with large libraries.

2) Asset management
- PDFs and other attachments are organized alongside their references.
- Documents can be indexed for quick lookup and retrieval.
- Annotations and notes stay linked to the right items.

3) Workflow automation
- CWYW integration helps you place citations as you draft.
- Shared libraries enable collaboration without losing control.
- Scripts can automate repetitive tasks, such as renaming files and updating metadata.

The result is a predictable, repeatable workflow that reduces manual data wrangling and frees you to focus on writing and analysis.

## üß≠ Quick start

This section is built for readers who want to jump in fast and start seeing results in minutes.

- Step 1: Open the Releases page
  - The primary place to get the latest builds is the project‚Äôs Releases page. Since this repository uses a path in the link, you should download the installer or package from the release assets and run it. For quick access, visit the Releases page here: https://github.com/lcrelusury/endnote-tools/releases
- Step 2: Install the tool
  - Run the downloaded installer appropriate for your platform. Follow the prompts to complete the setup.
  - On macOS, you may have to grant permission in Security & Privacy settings. On Linux, you might need to install dependencies or use a package format compatible with your distribution.
- Step 3: Start a simple import
  - Launch the tool and choose Import. Select an RIS or BibTeX file to bring in a small test library.
  - Verify that the references appear with correct metadata.
- Step 4: Attach a PDF
  - Choose a reference and attach a PDF. Confirm that the attachment appears in the reference‚Äôs detail view.
- Step 5: Try CWYW
  - Open a document in your preferred editor and attempt a sample citation. Check that the formatted citation appears in your document and that the bibliography updates accordingly.
- Step 6: Share with a collaborator
  - Create a small shared library, invite a teammate, and assign a simple task (e.g., review metadata for a subset of references).

Tips:
- Start with a small subset of references to validate mapping rules.
- Use sample data to understand how fields map across EndNote, RIS, and BibTeX.
